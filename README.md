Some animations I have made. You are welcome to use these for educational or press purposes, with attribution.

<b> tonga_wave_labeled </b>

Based on 10-minute GOES-West IR (band 13) data, from 4 UTC - 10:50 UTC, 15 January 2022, downloaded from the AWS. The data is first slightly smoothed (20 iterations of a 1-2-1 filter in lat and lon) and then the difference is calculated between each time step, to highlight the wave propagation. The differences are then animated with ParaView.
