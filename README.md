# animations

Some animations I have made. You are welcome to use these for educational or press purposes, with attribution.

<b> tonga_wave_labeled </b>

Initial atmospheric response to Tonga eruption

Based on 10-minute GOES-West IR (band 13) data, from 4 UTC - 10:50 UTC, 15 January 2022, downloaded from the AWS. The data is first slightly smoothed (20 iterations of a 1-2-1 filter in lat and lon) and then the difference is calculated between each time step, to highlight the wave propagation. The differences are then animated with ParaView.

<b> tonga_eumet_labeled </b>

Atmospheric response to Tonga eruption going in to and out of the antipodal point over North Africa

EUMETSAT IR data, 18 UTC 15 Jan - 2 UTC 16 Jan, 15-minute differences. Faster animation rate than the initial response animation, as the wave front is more difficult to see.
