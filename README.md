<b> hgt_anim.gif </b>

This animation takes a 2D figure of 500 hPa heights and winds and adds 3D perspective to the elevation of the height field. (Vertical scale greatly exagerated.) The original figure was made in python and the animation was made in Blender.

<b> tonga_wave_labeled </b>

Initial atmospheric response to Tonga eruption

Based on 10-minute GOES-West IR (band 13) data, from 4 UTC - 10:50 UTC, 15 January 2022, downloaded from the AWS. The data is first slightly smoothed (20 iterations of a 1-2-1 filter in lat and lon) and then the difference is calculated between each time step, to highlight the wave propagation. The differences are then animated with ParaView.

<b> tonga_meteosat_antipode </b>

Atmospheric response to Tonga eruption going in to and out of the antipodal point over North Africa

Meteosat-11 15-minute IR data, 18 UTC 15 Jan - 2 UTC 16 Jan.


<b> tonga_2_sat </b>

Combination of GOES-West and Meteosat 11 to show the first 60 hours of global atmospheric response, beginning at 4 UTC on 15 January 2022.
