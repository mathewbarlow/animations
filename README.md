Some animations I have made. You are welcome to use these for educational or press purposes, with attribution.

<b> tonga_wave_labeled </b>

Initial atmospheric response to Tonga eruption

Based on 10-minute GOES-West IR (band 13) data, from 4 UTC - 10:50 UTC, 15 January 2022, downloaded from the AWS. The data is first slightly smoothed (20 iterations of a 1-2-1 filter in lat and lon) and then the difference is calculated between each time step, to highlight the wave propagation. The differences are then animated with ParaView.

<b> tonga_meteosat_antipode </b>

Atmospheric response to Tonga eruption going in to and out of the antipodal point over North Africa

Meteosat-11 15-minute IR data, 18 UTC 15 Jan - 2 UTC 16 Jan.


<b> tonga_2_sat </b>

Combination of GOES-West and Meteosat 11 to show the first 60 hours of global atmospheric response, beginning at 4 UTC on 15 January 2022.
